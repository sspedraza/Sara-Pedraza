**ABOUT ME**

I am a Ph.D. student interested in plant ecology, montane ecosystems, and tropical biodiversity. 
As a Latin American female researcher, I aim to empower underrepresented communities in science while investigating tropical biodiversity. My research integrates fieldwork, lab work, and quantitative analyses to generate knowledge about the speciation of tropical plants.
